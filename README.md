# Are Wildfires on RISE? 
Comprehensive wildfire data analysis to determine cause 

To answer our research questions, we needed to find wildfire data that included the following criteria:
At least 2 decades worth of data (more if possible). 
Differentiates each wildfire incident by state, cause, and size.
Comprehensive data to include nationwide events.  
We found our data at Buzzfeed News and accessed it through their GitHub repo.
The data includes seven .csv files detailing every reported wildfire incident in the country from 1992 to 2015
Each .csv file was about 80 Mb’s containing information not relevant to our project. 
Sufficient time was spent on cleaning the data and putting it into a single workable data set.  

Our Null Hypothesis:
There is a measurable and/or significant increase in the number of wildfires in the United States?
Our Alt. Hypothesis:
There is a correlation between the rising number of fires and the rising temperature trends?
Additional questions we asked: 
What are the different causes for wildfires, and are any of them weather/climate related? 
What regions of the United States have the most wildfires? 

Initial task was to identify whether there is a measurable rise in wildfires with time. 
Further, nationwide combined data was analyzed to portray a graph of fires by state.
Top five states with the largest number of wildfires were identified.
Data for the top five states was further analyzed to demonstrate the primary causes of fire for these states. 
Correlation between wildfires and natural/human events were identified. 

There is a measurable increase in the number of wildfires in the US.
We confirm our Null Hypothesis.
There is a likely correlation between the increase in the number of wildfires and the rising temperatures. 
 We can neither confirm or deny our Alt. Hypothesis. 
While California and Georgia  lead the way with the total number of fires, Arkansas and Idaho are inflicted with the most damage. 
Six out of the 13 causes (~46%) of wildfires are caused by human error and are likely accelerated by favorable weather conditions. A national strategy/policy needs to set in places to minimize these cause.
